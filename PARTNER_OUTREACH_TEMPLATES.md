# GitPlumbers Partner Outreach Templates

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template 1: LinkedIn Connection (Cold Outreach)**

### **Subject: Building a network of senior React/Vue/Node specialists**

Hi [Name],

I came across your profile and was impressed by your [specific work/contribution - e.g., "React performance optimization work at [Company]" or "contributions to [open source project]"].

I'm building GitPlumbers, a consultancy that connects clients with curated senior developers across different frameworks. Rather than being another agency with junior devs, we're creating a network of proven specialists who can take on enterprise-level projects.

I'm looking for a few React experts who might be interested in high-quality project opportunities - think $100-150/hour, interesting technical challenges, and clients who actually value expertise.

Would you be open to a 15-minute chat about how this might work? No pressure - just exploring if there's mutual interest.

Best,
[Your name]
GitPlumbers - Technical Consultancy Network

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template 2: Email Follow-up (Warm Connection)**

### **Subject: Partnership opportunity - GitPlumbers technical network**

Hi [Name],

Hope you're doing well! I remember our conversation about [specific context - project, meetup, previous work together].

I've been building something I think might interest you. GitPlumbers started as my solo consulting practice, but I'm evolving it into a curated network of senior specialists across different frameworks.

**The concept:**

- I handle client relationships, project management, and quality oversight
- You handle what you do best - technical delivery in your expertise area
- We split revenue (typically 60/40 after client acquisition costs)
- Projects range from $5K code reviews to $50K+ full modernizations

**What I'm looking for:**

- Senior developers (5+ years) with proven client communication skills
- Specialists in React, Vue, Angular, Node.js, Python, or DevOps
- People who want project variety without the business development hassle

**Recent example:**
Just finished a React migration project - 6 weeks, $25K, client was thrilled. Would have loved to have a React specialist handle the technical side while I managed the relationship and architecture decisions.

Interested in a quick call to explore this? I'm thinking 20 minutes to see if it makes sense for both of us.

Best,
[Your name]

P.S. Even if partnership isn't a fit, I'd love to have you in my network for referrals both ways.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template 3: Stack Overflow/GitHub (Community Outreach)**

### **Comment on their helpful answer/contribution:**

Great explanation of [technical topic]! This is exactly the kind of expertise I look for when building technical teams for clients.

I run GitPlumbers, a consultancy that connects enterprises with senior specialists like yourself. If you're ever interested in project opportunities (React modernization, performance optimization, etc.), I'd love to chat.

No pressure - just always on the lookout for quality developers who can communicate complex topics clearly (like your answer here demonstrates).

Feel free to reach out if you're curious: [your email] or connect on LinkedIn.

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template 4: Meetup/Conference Follow-up**

### **Subject: Great meeting you at [Event] - partnership opportunity**

Hi [Name],

Really enjoyed our conversation about [specific technical topic] at [Event]. Your insights on [specific point they made] were spot-on.

I mentioned I was building a technical consultancy network - wanted to follow up on that. GitPlumbers connects clients with senior specialists across different frameworks, and based on our conversation, you'd be exactly the kind of [React/Vue/Node/etc.] expert I'm looking for.

**How it works:**

- I handle sales, project management, client relationships
- You focus on technical delivery in your expertise area
- Revenue split: 60/40 (you get 60% of technical delivery fees)
- Projects: $5K-50K range, 2-12 week engagements typically

**Recent example:**
Just wrapped a Vue.js modernization project - client had a legacy jQuery app that needed to become a modern SPA. 8 weeks, $18K, mostly remote work. Would have been perfect for a Vue specialist.

Want to grab coffee next week and explore this? I'm thinking [specific day/time] at [location near them].

Best,
[Your name]

## ðŸŽ¯ **Template 5: Referral Request (Existing Network)**

### **Subject: Know any senior React/Vue/Node specialists?**

Hi [Name],

I'm expanding GitPlumbers from solo consulting into a curated network of specialists. Looking for people who:

- Have 5+ years experience with [specific framework]
