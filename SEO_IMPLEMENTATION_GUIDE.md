# SEO Implementation Guide for GitPlumbers Blog Generator

## Overview
This guide documents the SEO improvements implemented in the blog generator to drive traffic to gitplumbers.com without making articles sound spammy.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Article Schema
The `GeneratedArticlePayload` interface now includes:

```typescript
interface GeneratedArticlePayload {
  // ... existing fields ...
  internalLinks: InternalLink[];        // 2-4 internal links with descriptive anchors
  primaryCTA?: CTA;                     // Primary conversion action
  secondaryCTA?: CTA;                   // Optional secondary CTA
  author?: Author;                      // Author information for E-E-A-T
  schemaHints?: SchemaHints;            // Structured data hints
}
```

### 2. Internal Linking Strategy
- **2-4 internal links per article** with descriptive anchor text
- Links point to key pages: `/services/*`, `/guides`, `/case-studies`, `/contact`, `/about`
- Anchor text matches article content (e.g., "modernization assessment", "observability setup")

### 3. Call-to-Action (CTA) System
- **Primary CTA** required for each article
- **Secondary CTA** optional
- UTM tracking included for analytics
- Examples: "Book a modernization assessment", "Explore our services"

### 4. Author Information (E-E-A-T)
- Credible author names and titles
- 1-2 sentence bios demonstrating expertise
- Optional LinkedIn/profile URLs

### 5. Structured Data Hints
- `aboutEntity: "GitPlumbers"` for organization signals
- `faqIsFAQPage: true` when FAQ is present
- `articleSection` for categorization

## Brand Integration Strategy

### What the AI Model Does:
- Mentions "GitPlumbers" naturally once in deck or conclusion
- Generates contextual internal links with descriptive anchors
- Creates conversion-focused CTAs
- Provides credible author information

### What the Template Should Do:
- Render Organization JSON-LD with LinkedIn company page
- Display consistent byline with logo
- Implement internal links in article body
- Show CTAs prominently
- Include LinkedIn social link in footer
